# Machine Learning Lessons and Projects

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of lessons and projects on Machine Learning (ML). It covers both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning algorithms, along with practical implementations and in-depth explanations of various techniques. The content is designed to help you understand and apply ML concepts effectively.

## Contents
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  - And more...

- **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**
  - k-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Ensemble Learning
  - And more...

- **Projects**
  - Predictive modeling using regression techniques
  - Classification challenges with real-world datasets
  - Clustering analysis on unlabeled data
  - Dimensionality reduction and data visualization
  - Custom ML pipelines and model evaluation

## Installation
To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Phavour-EBEN/Simplilearn-ML.git
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Each lesson and project is organized in a separate folder with its own instructions.

### Running a Lesson/Project
Navigate to the desired folder and follow the instructions provided in the README. You can run the Python scripts directly or through Jupyter Notebooks.

Example:
```bash
cd supervised-learning/linear-regression
python linear_regression.py
```

### Notebooks
For lessons and projects available as Jupyter Notebooks, you can start the notebook server using:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then open the desired `.ipynb` file in your browser.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional content to add, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.
